# Liquid Glass To-Do App

This repository contains two small examples of a to-do application using a liquid-glass style interface.

## SwiftUI Example

The SwiftUI implementation lives in the `LiquidGlassTodo` directory. These files are intended to be added to an Xcode project targeting iOS 15 or later. Build and run the app on a simulator or device to see the glassmorphism aesthetic in action.

## Web Example

A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript version is available in `LiquidGlassTodoWeb`. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to experiment with the same look and feel directly on the web.
