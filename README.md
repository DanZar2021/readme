# Liquid Glass To-Do App

This repository contains a small example of a to-do application written in SwiftUI. The interface uses a "liquid glass" aesthetic, achieved with SwiftUI's `ultraThinMaterial` background and a blurred gradient.

The Swift source files can be found in the `LiquidGlassTodo` directory. These files are meant to be included in an Xcode project targeting iOS 15 or later.

To run the app, open the project in Xcode and build for an iOS simulator or device.
